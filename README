This is a Small Container Library, SCL.

This library provides hash tables, list, queue, stack, symbol, balanced binary
tree, and a vector as abstract data types.  Multiple independent instances of
the same abstract type can be used, each with its own arbitrary contents.

The SCL library does NOT redefine the world with SCL_int, SCL_long, etc.  The
libscl functions use standard arguments types, such as long, int, size_t.

For official releases of libscl, see the ttylinux extras web page:
