This is a Small Container Library, SCL.

This library provides hash tables, list, queue, stack, symbol, balanced binary
tree, and a vector as abstract data types.  Multiple independent instances of
the same abstract type can be used, each with its own arbitrary contents.

SCL does NOT redefine the world with SCL_int, SCL_long, etc.  The SCL functions
use arguments that are standard: long, int, size_t, etc.
