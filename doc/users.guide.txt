1 INTRODUCTION
==============

============
1.1 Overview
============

SCL is a library of C functions implementing several general purpose containers
(abstract data types) that provide hash tables, linked list, queue, stack,
symbol, balanced binary tree, and indexed array (vector).  Multiple independent
instances of the same container (abstract type) can be used, each with its own
arbitrary contents.

SCL tries to work with you and does not redefine the world with things like
SCLint, SCLlong, etc.  SCL functions use arguments that are standard types,
such as long, int, size_t.

SCL is distributed as source code under the GNU Library Public License and is
freely available at:

The SCL source code is distributed in several formats; zip and tar compressed
with gzip and bzip2 should be available.

These are the systems on which I know SCL builds:

	o x86_64 Linux 2.6.X, GCC 4.3.2, GNU Make 3.81, GNU C Lib 2.9
	o i386 Linux 2.6.X, GCC 3.4.1, GNU Make 3.80, GNU C Lib 2.3.4
	o Solaris (SunOS 5.9), GCC 2.95.2, GNU Make 3.79.1

==============
2 BUILDING SCL
==============

SCL is completely written in C.  The SCL code is developed with strict Standard
C (ANSI/ISO) compliance enforced by compiler options.  The SCL makefile in the
src directory has compiler command options for "Standard C" compliance.

Building SCL results in the creation of an SCL library, or libraries, depending
on the OS.

On Linux and Solaris, building SCL creates a static library "libscl.a" and
shared object library "libscl.so.<version>" where <version> is some version
numbering.  There also are a few symlinks to the shared object library.

On Windows, building SCL creates "scl.dll".

=================================================
2.1 Compiling and Installing SCL - Linux, Solaris
=================================================

_Compile_SCL_

Go into the src directory and type "make"; this builds SCL without optimization
and without any debugging symbols.  Use the command "make optimize" to build
SCL with optimization.  Use the command "make debug" to build SCL with debugging
symbols.

_Install_SCL_

Go into the src directory and type "make install"; probably you need to be root
to do this.  The default install location prefix is /usr/local; this default is
set in the make variable INSTALL_PREFIX.

The SCL header files install into ${INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/scl.

The SCL library files install into ${INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib.

The scl-config script installs into ${INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin.

To change the default install location prefix, specify the location on the make
command line like this:

	make INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/local install

This will install the header files into ${HOME}/local/include/scl, library files
into ${HOME}/local/lib, and the scl-config script into ${HOME}/local/bin.

==========================================
2.2 Compiling and Installing SCL - Windows
==========================================

Compile SCL:	Double-click the MS Visual C/C++ 6 workspace file, scl.dsw, in
		the _MSVC6 folder.  Use the IDE to build.

Install SCL:	I dunno windows.

============================================================================
3.1 Accessing the Installed SCL Header Files and Library(s) - Linux, Solaris
============================================================================

_scl-config_

scl-config is an executable shell script; it should become installed when the
SCL header files and library(s) are installed.  scl-config takes one or more
command-line options; for each command-line option scl-config prints some text
to standard output.  If no command-line option is given, then scl-config
displays the list of command-line options that it accepts.  The command-line
options to scl-config are:

	Option		Returned Value Printed to Standard Output
	--------------	-----------------------------------------
	
	--prefix	The common path prefix to the installation directories.

	--credits	A copyright notice.

	--version	The SCL version.

	--cflags	The include file path needed to compile programs that
			use SCL.  This is printed as a compiler command-line
			option, like this: -I/usr/local/include/scl

	--shared-libs	The SCL shared library file path and name needed to
			link programs that use SCL.  This is printed as a
			linker command-line option, like this:
			-L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib -lscl

	--static-libs	The SCL static library file path and name needed to
			link programs that use SCL.  This is printed as a
			linker command-line option, like this:
			-L/usr/local/lib -lscl

_Header_Files_

When compiling code that uses SCL, the compiler needs an include path to the SCL
header files.  Use the scl-config script on the compilation command line like
this to generate the appropriate compiler command-line option:

	gcc -c -o test.o `scl-config --cflags` -I- test.c

The --cflags option to the scl-config script returns the include path; you can
try it on the command line to see what it is.

There typically are two include file paths, one for local files and one for
system files.  The local include file path is used like this #include "..." and
the system include file path is used like this #include <...>.  The -I- compiler
command-line option switches command-line include path options from the local to
the system include path.  Therefore, in the above example the path to the SCL
header files is in the local include file path.

_Library_Files_

When linking code with SCL, the linker needs a path to the SCL library and the
SCL library file itself needs to be included in the link command.  Use the
scl-config script to generate the link command-line options for linking with
SCL.

For linking with the shared library use `scl-config --shared-libs`, like this:

	gcc -o test test.o `scl-config --shared-libs` -lc

For linking with the static library use `scl-config --static-libs`, like this:

	gcc -o test test.o `scl-config --static-libs` -lc

_How_to_Make_a_gdb_Backtrace_

Backtraces can help me fix bugs that make applications crash.  If you find a
bug that crashes an application, please send a backtrace with your bug report.

To make a useful backtrace, you need a core file with debugging information
produced by the application when it crashes.

When it does crash, type the following from your shell:

	script
	gdb <application> core

Then, in the gdb prompt type "bt".  Blammo, you've got the backtrace in front
of you.  Quit from gdb by typing "quit", then in the shell prompt type "quit".
The file named typescript will contain the backtrace.

4 PROGRAMMING WITH SCL
======================

================
4.1 Header Files
================

The Small Container Library, SCL, is organized in a simple way: for each
container there is one ".h" header file that specifies the container's external
interface.  The name of an SCL header file is the simple name of a container
with a prefix of "SCL_".  For example, the SCL balanced binary tree header file
is named "SCL_tree.h".

There is an exception.  The SCL header files "SCL.h" does not belong to a
particular container; it is a collection of general SCL definitions.  The other
SCL header files include "SCL.h" and it is not intended to be included directly
by user's source code.

==============
4.2 Containers
==============

SCL is a library of containers, "semi-containers", and one non-container.

Container   Type   Capability                               Header File
---------   ----   ----------                               -----------
config ..... n ... SCL configuration functions ............ SCL_config.h
hash ....... c ... collision table, ASCII-Z key ........... SCL_hash.h
list ....... c ... doubly-linked list, size_t indexible ... SCL_list.h
map ........ c ... collision table, long-size key ......... SCL_map.h
queuebuf ... s ... bytes queue, single queue block ........ SCL_queuebuf.h
stackbuf ... s ... bytes stack, external block storage .... SCL_stackbuf.h
symbol ..... s ... data type abstraction .................. SCL_symbol.h
tree ....... c ... linked balanced tree, long-size key .... SCL_tree.h
vector ..... c ... indexed array, size_t indexible ........ SCL_vector.h

Type   Legend
----   ------
  n  - non-container
  s  - semi-container
  c  - container

The SCL differentiation of containers from semi-containers is that containers
can contain any sort of object, or data type, and semi-containers are more
specialized in what they contain.

SCL Containers, being implemented in C, don't really contain a copy of (have
internal contents at run-time) any arbitrary data type.  They can be said to
"contain" any sort of object, or data type, by using a void pointer to whatever
is given to them.  Because SCL containers use void pointer references to their
contents they have no information about the data type being contained; this
results in particular container behavior:

o  SCL containers cannot allocate or deallocate contents.  [SCL containers do
   allocate and deallocate for internal usage.  Adding/deleting contents to/from
   a container typically results in the container allocating/deallocating for
   the container's internal store, NOT for the contents being added/deleted.]

o  A single SCL container can contain contents of different data types.  The
   user, of course, is responsible for knowing which contents are of which data
   type.

o  When contents are deleted from an SCL container, the contents themselves
   still exist, because the container only had a void pointer to the contents.
   The user is responsible for managing the contents, including deallocation if
   the contents were dynamically allocated.  SCL container delete functions
   return the void pointer to the contents; this supports the user not loosing
   the content's reference.

o  The SCL allocator and deallocator are exposed in the SCL external interface.
   These functions are:

	void* scl_alloc (size_t size); /* sets allocated memory to zero */
	void scl_free (void* item); /* free only items from scl_alloc() */

o  These are exposed to support a consistent allocation/deallocation mechanism
   between SCL and the SCL user.  Here is an example of where this is important:
   Some containers, or semi-containers, have a size of the contents along with
   a pointer to the contents.  In this case, the container can duplicate the
   contents when requested (as opposed to returning a copy of the pointer to
   the contents).  The container/semi-container duplicates the contents by
   allocating for the appropriate size and copying from the pointer reference
   into the allocated memory.  The user is then responsible for deallocating
   the duplicated contents.  The user's deallocation needs to be compatible
   with the SCL allocation.

The non-container is "config"; it is a group of functions that return, decode,
or use SCL configuration.

==========================
4.3 Function Return Values
==========================

Some SCL functions return an integer data value; don't confuse the returned
integer data value with a status indication.

Many SCL functions return an integer status value.  The general scheme for SCL
integer status return values are that 0 indicates no error, negative values
indicate an error.  The negative error values are small in magnitude, and SCL
defines corresponding symbolic error names:

Binary Value  Symbolic Name    General Meaning
------------  -------------    ---------------
    0 ....... SCL_OK ......... Nothing wrong, all ok.
   -1 ....... SCL_ERROR ...... General, unspecified  error.
   -2 ....... SCL_BADARG ..... Bad function argument.
   -3 ....... SCL_CORRUPT .... Internal (memory) corruption.
   -4 ....... SCL_NOMEM ...... Can not allocate memory.
   -5 ....... SCL_NOTFOUND ... Can not find item.
   -6 ....... SCL_NOSVC ...... Service not available.
   -7 ....... SCL_DUPKEY ..... Duplicate key.

Some SCL functions may return a positive number upon success; the positive
number being actual data, not a status value.  In this case the integer return
value can sometimes be a status indication (when negative) and sometimes be
actual data (when positive).  The negative-value status indication is said to
be "out of band", because it is not actual data, and this sort of interface is
said to be Not Good.  But it is really convenient.

The SCL function scl_statstr() takes an integer SCL status value as an argument
and returns a constant character string of text that is a short description.
It might be used like this:

	stat = list_insert (list, 5, data);
	if (stat != SCL_OK) {
		printf ("error inserting in list: %s\n", scl_statstr(stat));
	}

Another case of SCL functions returning "out of band" values are functions that
return a pointer when successful, or NULL upon failure.  Most of these return a
pointer, or NULL, as an SCL data type such as SCL_list_t, SCL_tree_t, and
SCL_iterator_t.

An SCL_iterator_t can be used with any SCL container that has iterators, but
access ONLY the same container that set the iterator.

For instance, this is OK:

	SCL_iterator_t   iterator; /* carefully use with any container */
	void*            data;

	iterator = hash_at (hash, "this is the key");
	if (iterator == NULL) return;
	data = hash_data_get (iterator);

	iterator = list_end (list);
	if (iterator == NULL) return;
	data = list_data_get (iterator);

This is a big error:

	SCL_iterator_t   iterator; /* carefully use with any container */
	void*            data;

	iterator = hash_at (hash, "this is the key");
	if (iterator == NULL) return;
	data = hash_data_get (iterator);
	data = list_data_get (iterator); /* OUCH! hash table iterator */

const char* hash_key_get (SCL_iterator_t i);
void hash_foreach (SCL_hash_t h, SCL_cbfn_t f, void* c);

Include the file SCL_hash.h for the SCL hash table prototypes.

The hash table container is used for storage and retrieval of data values that
are associated with keys, often called "key-value pairs".  A key is an ASCII-Z
string (an ASCII-Z string is the typical null character-terminated string used
in C).  The data value part of a key-value pair is anything to which a void
pointer can point.

The key is "hashed" to generate an index into the table; the data is stored in
the table at the index.  A collision happens when two keys hash to the same
index; this is why hash tables are sometimes called collision tables.
Collisions are resolved by a linear search for a next open spot in the table,
into which the data is put.

An user-supplied hash function can be given to hash_new(), and the hash table
will use it instead of the internal default hash function.  Use NULL as the
argument to hash_new() and the internal default hash function will be used.  If
used, the user-supplied hash function should be declared like this:

	int32_t mdfn (const char* messageText, size_t messageLength);

Some hash functions are called Message Digest functions; they take ASCII-Z
"messages" and create a "digest".

SCL hash tables have a size that is a number of indexible locations; each
indexible location can hold a list of distinct key-value pairs.  The index for
a key-value pair is generated by "hashing" the key.  The size of a hash table
is gotten by hash_size(), and the number of items (key-value pairs) is gotten
by hash_count().

The only method of putting data into a hash table is to use hash_insert(), this
function returns a SCL_DUPKEY error value if the key is a duplicate of some
existing key in the hash table.

A hash table container uses a small amount of memory when created and grows as
items are added.  At particular times, when the number of items in a hash table
is some multiple of available hash table indexes, the hash table grows by at
least one factor of 2 (probably 2*2, which is 4).  This happens only during the
hash_insert() function, so sometimes that function takes a "long" time while
the entire hash table is rebuilt.

The hash_remove() function returns the data value being removed from a hash
table.

The hash_foreach() function iterates through each data value in a hash table
and invokes the user-supplied callback function for each data value.  The order
of the data values that is given to the user-supplied callback function may be
strange.  The user-supplied callback function should be declared like this:

	int cbfn (
                 const char* key,
                 long        hashTableIndex,
                 void*       data,
                 void*       context
                 );

The context argument of the callback function is the same user-supplied value
given to hash_foreach().

If the callback function returns anything other than SCL_NOTFOUND the iteration
being performed by hash_foreach() is terminated.

The hash_foreach() callback function argument CANNOT be NULL, unlike the
user-supplied hash function argument to hash_new().

The list container is used for storage and retrieval of data values with rapid
insertion and deletion at the ends (front and back).  The data value is anything
to which a void pointer can point.  Lists can conveniently implement stacks and
queues.

The list_foreach() function iterates through each data value in a list and
invokes the user-supplied callback function for each data value.  The first
argument to the callback function is set to NULL with list_foreach(), and the
callback function should be declared like this:

	int cbfn (
                 const char* unused,
                 long        listIndex,
                 void*       data,
                 void*       context
                 );

The context argument of the callback function is the same user-supplied value
given to list_foreach().

If the callback function returns anything other than SCL_NOTFOUND the iteration
being performed by list_foreach() is terminated.

The list_foreach() callback function argument CANNOT be NULL.

void* map_data_get (SCL_iterator_t i);
void map_foreach (SCL_map_t m, SCL_cbfn_t f, void* c);

Include the file SCL_map.h for the SCL map prototypes.

The map container is used for storage and retrieval of data values that are
associated with keys, often called "key-value pairs".  A key is a long.  The
data value part of a key-value pair is anything to which a void pointer can
point.

An SCL map is very much like an SCL hash table, and is implemented almost
identically.

The only method of putting data into a map is to use map_insert(), this
function returns a SCL_DUPKEY error value if the key is a duplicate of some
existing key in the map.

A map container uses a small amount of memory when created and grows as items
are added.  At particular times, when the number of items in a map is some
multiple of available map indexes, the map grows by at least one factor of 2
(probably 2*2, which is 4).  This happens only during the map_insert()
function, so sometimes that function takes a "long" time while the entire map
is rebuilt.

The map_foreach() function iterates through each data value in a map and
invokes the user-supplied callback function for each data value.  The order of
the data values that is given to the user-supplied callback function may be
strange.  The first argument to the callback function is set to NULL with
map_foreach(), and the callback function should be declared like this:

	int cbfn (
                 const char* unused,
                 long        mapKey,
                 void*       data,
                 void*       context
                 );

The context argument of the callback function is the same user-supplied value
given to map_foreach().

If the callback function returns anything other than SCL_NOTFOUND the iteration
being performed by map_foreach() is terminated.

The map_foreach() callback function argument CANNOT be NULL.

queuebuf_foreach     - iterate through messages in the queuebuf data buffer

Prototypes (SCL_queuebuf.h)

int queuebuf_init (void* q, size_t s, size_t n);
void queuebuf_erase (void* q);
size_t queuebuf_count (void* q);
size_t queuebuf_header_size (void* q);
size_t queuebuf_buff_size (void* q);
size_t queuebuf_buff_used (void* q);
size_t queuebuf_buff_avail (void* q);
int queuebuf_put  (void* q, const void* d, size_t s);
int queuebuf_peek (void* q, void** d, size_t* s);
int queuebuf_get (void* q, void* d, size_t* s);
int queuebuf_get_alloc (void* q, void** d, size_t* s);
void queuebuf_foreach (void* q, SCL_cbfn_t f, void* c);

Include the file SCL_queuebuf.h for the SCL queuebuf prototypes.

The queuebuf container implements a message queue in a block of memory.  The
messages are a sequence of bytes.

The memory block is not allocated by the queuebuf container; it is given to,
and initialized by, the queuebuf container.  The memory block's allocation,
static or dynamic, should not affect the queuebuf container functions.  The
queuebuf container code never explicitly stores a pointer or any address in the
memory block; all queuebuf management is implemented using indexes and counts.

The rationale for the queuebuf container implementation is that the memory
block can be a block of shared memory that is shared between processes e.g., a
SYS V IPC shared memory segment allocated by shmget() wherein each process
accesses the same shared memory block, though each with process-specific
address.  The queuebuf container continues to operate properly in a threaded
environment, and in a single-context programming environment.

Of course, in a multi-context programming environment (thread or process),
mutual exclusion locking/unlocking must be used around the queuebuf container
usage.  SCL does not have mutual exclusion locking/unlocking.

The queuebuf_init() function takes a block of memory and initializes it for
queuebuf operation.  The memory block, size of the memory block and the maximum
number of messages for the queuebuf are arguments to queuebuf_init().  The
return value of queuebuf_init() is the total number of bytes available for
messages.  Some of the memory block is used for internal message management,
and some for the actual messages.

Check the return value from queuebuf_init().  It indicates the number of bytes
available in the queuebuf for messages.  It is a negative number when the size
of the memory block is not big enough for the maximum number of messages.

Here is an example of using queuebuf_init():

	void*  qbuf;
	size_t size;
	int    dataSize;

	size = 10000;
	qbuf = scl_alloc (size); /* this one is not shared between processes */
	if (qbuf == NULL) return -1;

	dataSize = queuebuf_init (qbuf, size, 10); /* up to 10 messages */
	if (dataSize < 7000) { /* must have room for 7000 bytes */
		free (qbuf)
		return NULL;
	}

	return qbuf;

Use the function queuebuf_header_size() to find out the overhead of the
internal management; it is the number of bytes in the memory block used for the
header.

queuebuf_buff_size() returns the number of bytes available for message; this is
the data buffer area of the memory block.  This should be the same number
returned by queuebuf_init().

queuebuf_get() removes the oldest message from the queuebuf, copying it into a
buffer provided by the calling function.  The calling function may not have the
appropriate size buffer for the message returned by queuebuf_get(), so an
alternate function queuebuf_get_alloc() can be used.

queuebuf_get_alloc() removes the oldest message from the queuebuf, copying it
into a buffer the that the container function queuebuf_get_alloc() dynamically
allocates.  Remember to free this buffer with scl_free().

The queuebuf_foreach() function iterates through each message in a queuebuf and
invokes the user-supplied callback function for each message.  The order of the
messages that is given to the user-supplied callback function is from newest to
oldest.  The first argument to the callback function is set to NULL with
queuebuf_foreach(), and the callback function should be declared like this:

        int cbfn (
                 const char* unused,
                 long        messageSize,
                 void*       messageData,
                 void*       context
                 );

The context argument of the callback function is the same user-supplied value
given to queuebuff_foreach().

If the callback function returns anything other than SCL_NOTFOUND the iteration
being performed by queuebuf_foreach() is terminated.

The queuebuf_foreach() callback function argument CANNOT be NULL.

5.6 Stackbuf - Stack Buffer Container
=====================================

Functions

stackbuf_new        - create a new stackbuf
stackbuf_del        - delete a stackbuf
stackbuf_erase      - erase the contents of a stackbuf
stackbuf_size       - get the size of a stackbuf
stackbuf_nin        - get the number of memory blocks (buffers) brought in
stackbuf_nout       - get the number of memory blocks (buffers) brought out
stackbuf_push       - push data onto a stackbuf
stackbuf_pull       - pull data from a stackbuf
stackbuf_pull_alloc - pull data into an allocated buffer from a stackbuf
stackbuf_flush      - bring out an unfinished memory block (buffer)

Prototypes (SCL_stackbuf.h)

SCL_stackbuf_t stackbuf_new (SCL_getfn_t g, SCL_putfn_t p, size_t l);
void stackbuf_del (SCL_stackbuf_t s);
void stackbuf_erase (SCL_stackbuf_t s);
size_t stackbuf_size (SCL_stackbuf_t s);
size_t stackbuf_nin (SCL_stackbuf_t s);
size_t stackbuf_nout (SCL_stackbuf_t s);
int stackbuf_push (SCL_stackbuf_t s, const void* d, size_t l);
int stackbuf_pull (SCL_stackbuf_t s, void* d, size_t l);
int stackbuf_pull_alloc (SCL_stackbuf_t s, void** d, size_t l);
int stackbuf_flush (SCL_stackbuf_t s);

Include the file SCL_stackbuf.h for the SCL stackbuf prototypes.

The stackbuf container implements a stack of bytes in a block of memory.  When
data is pushed into a stackbuf that is full, a user-supplied callback function
is invoked to take the full memory block.  When data is pulled from an empty
stackbuf, a user-supplied callback functions is invoked to get a memory block.

The user-supplied callback functions for getting and putting memory blocks
should be declared like this:

	void* getfn (size_t a_size) {
		void* block;
		/* Get a block from somewhere.  The block is of size a_size. */
		return block;
	}

	int putfn (void* a_block, size_t a_size) {
		/*
		 * Store a block somewhere.  The block is pointed to by a_block
		 * and is of size a_size.
		 */
		return 0;
	}

It would make sense for getfn and putfn to use an SCL list as a stack to manage
the data buffer blocks.

The stackbuf container is a sort of deque, wherein bytes go in and out of one
end, and blocks of data bytes go in and out of the other end.

The user-supplied callback functions for getting and putting memory blocks, and
the size of memory blocks are the arguments to stackbuf_new, like this:

	SCL_stackbuf_t stackbuf;

	/*
	 * Create a stackbuf that has room for 250 bytes; the block size
	 * argument to the getfn and putfn will not be more than 250.
	 */
	stackbuf = stackbuf_new (getfn, putfn, 250);

When deleting a stackbuf with stackbuf_del(), any existing data is given to the
putfn with the size being the current amount of data.  For example (without
much error processing):

	SCL_stackbuf_t stackbuf;
	const char* data = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.";
	int stat;

	stackbuf = stackbuf_new (getfn, putfn, 250);
	if (stackbuf == NULL) return -1;

	/*
	 * putfn is not used here because the data buffer didn't fill up.
	 */
	stat = stackbuf_push (stackbuf, data, strlen(data));
	if (stat != SCL_OK) return -1;

	stackbuf_del (stackbuf); /* This will result in putfn being invoked, */
	                         /* because the buffer has data that would   */
	                         /* be otherwise lost.  Of course, if        */
	                         /* nothing is done with the data buffer,    */
	                         /* then nobody goes to jail.                */

stackbuf_erase() does not invoke the putfn.

stackbuf_size() returns the amount of data (bytes) currently in the stackbuf
data block.

stackbuf_nin() returns the number of times the getfn has been invoked.
stackbuf_nout() returns the number of times the putfn has been invoked.

stackbuf_push() invokes putfn whenever the stackbuf data buffer fills.  This
can be multiple times, like this (without descent error processing):

	SCL_stackbuf_t stackbuf;
	const char* data = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.";
	int stat;

	stackbuf = stackbuf_new (getfn, putfn, 20);
	if (stackbuf == NULL) return -1;

	/*
	 * putfn is invoked two times here because the data is more than twice
	 * the size of the data buffer.
	 */
	stat = stackbuf_push (stackbuf, data, strlen(data));
	if (stat != SCL_OK) return -1;

stackbuf_pull() returns the number of bytes returned from the stackbuf; it
invokes getfn whenever the stackbuf data buffer is empty, like this (with not
much good error processing):

	SCL_stackbuf_t stackbuf;
	char data[20];
	int size;

	stackbuf = stackbuf_new (getfn, putfn, 20);
	if (stackbuf == NULL) return -1;

	/*
	 * getfn is invoked here to get a data buffer of size 20 for the
	 * stackbuf.
	 */
	size = stackbuf_pull (stackbuf, data, 10);
	if (stat != 10) return -1;

stackbuf_pull_alloc() does the same thing as stackbuf_pull() but it dynamically
allocates a buffer for the returned data.  Remember to free this buffer with
scl_free().  Another example:

	SCL_stackbuf_t stackbuf;
	char* data;
	int size;

	stackbuf = stackbuf_new (getfn, putfn, 20);
	if (stackbuf == NULL) return -1;

	size = stackbuf_pull_alloc (stackbuf, &data, 10); /* getfn invoked */
	if (stat == 0) return -1;

	scl_free (data);

stackbuf_flush() simply invokes the putfn, if there is any data in the stackbuf.

Include the file SCL_symbol.h for the SCL symbol prototypes.

The symbol container is used for storage and retrieval of various data types
encapsulated within a uniform "symbol" wrapper.  In this way, one can have an
array or list of symbols, each symbol being of some distinct type, typically
integer, real, or string.

Symbols are handy when implementing a text parser, like the front end of some
sort of compiler.

An SCL symbol is initially un-initialized, and then can be set to a particular
type and appropriate value.  SCL defines symbolic names for symbol types:

Binary Value  Symbolic Name       General Meaning
------------  -------------       ---------------
     0 ...... SCL_SYMBOL_NONE ... Un-initialized symbol.
     1 ...... SCL_SYMBOL_INT .... Integer (long) symbol.
     2 ...... SCL_SYMBOL_REAL ... Real (double) symbol.
     3 ...... SCL_SYMBOL_PTR .... Pointer (void*) symbol.

symbol_new() dynamically allocates a new symbol and initializes its type to
SCL_SYMBOL_NONE.

symbol_del() free a dynamically allocated symbol.

symbol_stat() returns an integer value representing the type of the symbol; the
return value is SCL_SYMBOL_NONE, SCL_SYMBOL_INT, SCL_SYMBOL_REAL, or
SCL_SYMBOL_PTR.

symbol_int_set()
symbol_real_set()
symbol_ptr_set()
	These functions unconditionally set a symbol with a value and
	correspondingly set the symbol's type to SCL_SYMBOL_INT,
	SCL_SYMBOL_REAL, or SCL_SYMBOL_PTR.

symbol_int_get()
symbol_real_get()
symbol_ptr_get()
	These functions unconditionally get a symbol's value without checking
	the symbol's type.

symbol_int_set_safe()
symbol_real_set_safe()
symbol_ptr_set_safe()
	These functions set a symbol's value if the symbol is of the
	corresponding type; if not, SCL_NOSVC is returned.

symbol_int_get_safe()
symbol_real_get_safe()
symbol_ptr_get_safe()
	These functions get a symbol's value if the symbol is of the
	corresponding type; if not, SCL_NOSVC is returned.

The tree container keeps the tree structure balanced with respect to the key of
the key-value pair, and provides a fairly rapid insertion (theoretically order
NlogN on average with evenly distributed keys).

tree_foreach() is parameterized with a symbolic value that controls the
traversal algorithm:

Symbolic Name   Traversal Algorithm
-------------   -------------------
SCL_PREFIX .... Standard tree prefix traversal.
SCL_INFIX ..... Standard tree infix traversal.
SCL_POSTFIX ... Standard tree postfix traversal.

The first argument to the callback function is set to NULL with tree_foreach(),
and the callback function should be declared like this:

        int cbfn (
                 const char* unused,
                 long        key,
                 void*       data,
                 void*       context
                 );

The context argument of the callback function is the same user-supplied value
given to tree_foreach().

If the callback function returns anything other than SCL_NOTFOUND the traversal
being performed by tree_foreach() is terminated.

The tree_foreach() callback function argument CANNOT be NULL.

void vector_del (SCL_vector_t v);
void vector_erase (SCL_vector_t v);
size_t vector_size (SCL_vector_t v);
size_t vector_count (SCL_vector_t v);
int vector_push_back (SCL_vector_t v, const void* d);

void* vector_data_get (SCL_iterator_t i);
void vector_foreach (SCL_vector_t v, SCL_cbfn_t f, void* c);
void vector_reverse (SCL_vector_t v);

Include the file SCL_vector.h for the SCL vector prototypes.

The vector container is used for storage and retrieval of data values with
rapid insertion and deletion at the ends (front and back), and rapid indexed
access to any item.  The data value is anything to which a void pointer can
point.

A vector is an array.  A vector container uses a small amount of memory when
created and grows as items are added.  When a vector becomes full it grows by
twice its previous size.  This happens only during the vector_push_back()
function, so sometimes that function takes a "long" time while the entire
vector is rebuilt.

Notice that vector_push_back() is the only method of adding new items to a
vector.

The vector_foreach() function iterates through each data value in a vector and
invokes the user-supplied callback function for each data value.  The first
argument to the callback function is set to NULL with vector_foreach(), and the
callback function should be declared like this:

        int cbfn (
                 const char* unused,
                 long        index,
                 void*       data,
                 void*       context
                 );

The context argument of the callback function is the same user-supplied value
given to vector_foreach().

If the callback function returns anything other than SCL_NOTFOUND the iteration
being performed by vector_foreach() is terminated.

The vector_foreach() callback function argument CANNOT be NULL.

APPENDIX A - GNU Free Document License
======================================


GNU Free Documentation License
                  Version 1.2, November 2002


 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
