                            Small Container Library

http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libscl/


============
Introduction
============

This is a Small Container Library, SCL.

If you are not sure what a container is, then ignore the word container in this
file and you'll probably understand everything.

This library provides hash tables, list, queue, stack, symbol, balanced binary
tree, and a vector as abstract data types.  Multiple independent instances of
the same abstract type can be used, each with its own arbitrary contents.

SCL does not redefine the world with SCL_int, SCL_long, etc.  The SCL functions
use arguments that are standard: long, int, size_t, etc.


=======
Systems
=======

These are the systems on which I know SCL builds:

     o Linux 2.6.X, GCC 3.4.1, GNU Make 3.80, GNU C Lib 2.3.4, i386
     o Linux 2.6.X, GCC 4.3.2, GNU Make 3.81, GNU C Lib 2.9, x86_64
     o Solaris (SunOS 5.9), GCC 2.95.2, GNU Make 3.79.1
     o Win98 WinNT Win2K WinXP, MS Visual C/C++ 6


=========
Build SCL
=========

Linux:  Go into the src directory and type "make".  Build with optimization with
        the command "make optimize".  Build with debugging symbols with the
        command "make debug".

Windows:  Double-click the MS Visual C/C++ 6 workspace file, scl.dsw, in
          the _MSVC6 folder.  Use the IDE to build.


===========
Install SCL
===========

Linux:  Go into the src directory and type "make install"; probably you need to
        be root to do install into a directory that is outside of your home
        directory tree.  The default install location prefix is /usr/local;
        this default is set in the make variable INSTALL_PREFIX.

        The SCL header files install into ${INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/scl.
        The SCL library files install into ${INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib.
        The scl-config script installs into ${INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin.

        To change the default install location prefix, specify the location on
        the make command line like this:

             make INSTALL_PREFIX=~/local install

        This will install the header files into ~/local/include/scl, library
        files into ~/local/lib, and the scl-config script into ~/local/bin.

        Note: The path ${INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin should be in your $PATH, or
              otherwise you will not be able to use the scl-config script.

Windows:  I dunno windows.


=======
Use SCL
=======

Include the SCL header file for the container e.g., include SCL_tree.h in any
file that uses an SCL tree; include SCL_hash.h in any file that uses an SCL
hash table.  Don't include SCL.h; it is used by the other SCL header files when
needed.

If there is not sufficient documentation in the <libscl>/doc directory, then use
the header files in the <libscl>/src directory and the test programs under the
<libscl>/test directory for reference.

Linux:  When compiling code that uses SCL, the compiler needs an include path to
        the SCL header files.  Use the scl-config script on the compilation
        command line like this to generate the appropriate compiler command-line
        option:

             gcc -c -o test.o `scl-config --cflags` test.c

        The --cflags option to the scl-config script returns the include path;
        you can try it on the command line to see what it is.

        When linking code with SCL, use the scl-config script to generate the
        link command-line options for linking with SCL.  For linking with the
        shared library use `scl-config --shared-libs`:

             gcc -o test test.o `scl-config --shared-libs` -lc

        For linking with the static library use `scl-config --static-libs`:

             gcc -o test test.o `scl-config --static-libs` -lc

======================================
Debugging: How to Make a gdb Backtrace
======================================

Linux:  Backtraces can help me fix bugs that make applications crash.  If you
        find a bug that crashes an application, please send a backtrace with
        your bug report.

        To make a useful backtrace, you need a core file with debugging
        information produced by the application when it crashes.

        When it does crash, type the following from your shell:

             script
             gdb <application> core

        Then, in the gdb prompt type "bt".  Blammo, you've got the backtrace in
        front of you.  Quit from gdb by typing "quit", then in the shell prompt
        type "quit".  The file named typescript will contain the backtrace.
